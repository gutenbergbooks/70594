THE ENGADINE
</p>

<p><br><br></p>

<h3>
I
<br><br>
THE LAKE DISTRICT
</h3>

<p>
'Ille terrarum mihi præter omnes angulus ridet' is
the inscription that greets the traveller over the
post-stables at Silvaplana.  He is, perhaps, a little
surprised, not having hitherto thought of stables and the
postal service as haunts of classic culture; but those
who know the Upper Engadine will readily accept
the quotation as expressing their feeling towards it.
There is something about that high-lying,
broad-stretched valley, though its scenery is seldom of
a dramatic, overmastering kind, that gives it a
quite individual claim when Memory makes up her
jewels.
</p>

<p>
There is an individual note, too, about the people,
a suggestion of peculiar history that mocks us as we try
to seize it.  One of the earliest documents in a people's
archives is ordinarily their language, but that spoken
by Engadiners, the interesting form of Romanic
known as Ladin, one of the many tongues evolved
from late Latin, only takes us back to the Roman
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P10"></a>10}</span>
conquest of the Rhaetian upland that won the
magniloquent admiration of Horace.  In truth, the
population is a human document, a palimpsest on which the
Romans are but the latest and most masterful writers.
Since, at the commencement of our era, the soldiers
of Drusus and Tiberius wrote their enduring record,
there have been only interlineations, mainly Teutonic,
but many are the traces of antecedent scripts.  Could
we read below the prevailing Latin, we should probably
find an elusive Keltic romance and enwoven with
it perhaps a grave Etruscan legend, while scattered
through all are undecipherable memorials of forgotten
races and perished tongues.  One ethnic wave after
another has surged up that ancient highway from
central Europe into Italy, and each as it passed or
receded has contributed some component to the
population.
</p>

<p>
But even the briefest sketch of the tangled history
of the Engadine is beyond the scope of this booklet.
I will stick to my little last, the graceless business
of cutting away four out of every five pages of a
previous work which the world has willingly let die.*
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="footnote">
* This little book is mainly an abridgment of 'The Upper
Engadine' (A. and C. Black, 1906).
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Most travellers enter the Engadine by the tunnel
under the Albula, having slowly wound up from Chur
along a line that can hardly be surpassed in bold
engineering and romantic variety.  After a momentary
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P11"></a>11}</span>
halt at Spinas, we steam for a couple of miles
down Val Bevers&mdash;very interesting to the geologist
and botanist, the singular mixture of Alpine and
meadow flora can be noted even from the rail&mdash;and
reach the valley of the Inn at Bevers, where are
some excellent specimens of the quaint old Engadine
houses that have no small part in giving the valley its
individual character.  Away on the east stands Piz
Esan, a bold, bare, dolomitic mass capped with
Rhaetic, which is the south-western sentinel of the
lately established National Park.
</p>

<p>
The rail turns right and left.  Let us turn right to
Samaden, administratively the chief village of the
Upper Engadine.  Here, too, are good examples of
old Engadine architecture, including a house of the
Plantas, one of the ancient families of the valley
whose name is writ large on every page of its history.
St. Peter's at Samaden enjoys a traditional primacy
among the churches of the valley, and has many
representative functions.  It bears the date 1491, but
this must refer to the rebuilding of the nave; the
Romanesque tower must date from the tenth or
eleventh century.  Switzerland has old churches in
plenty, but both care and neglect have combined to
denude them of nearly all the interesting features that
the belfries show they must have possessed.  Protestantism
is often blamed for this, but in artistic desert
I do not know that there is much to choose between
the two communions; such difference as there may be
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P12"></a>12}</span>
is expressed in two different estimates of George IV.
Someone remarked that he had no taste.  'On the
contrary,' said another, 'he's a great deal of taste, but
it's bad.'
</p>

<p>
Piz Ot, near Samaden, is a superb point of view;
the neighbouring Piz Padella is interesting botanically
and geologically.
</p>

<p>
A mile beyond Samaden are Celerina and Cresta, now
merged into one.  Plate II. is a view on the way:
in the background Piz Albriz, on the right a buttress
of the sombre Piz Chalchaign, Pontresina in middle
distance; nearer, standing lorn among the tombs on
a little larch-clad hill, the ancient church of San Gian,
which, except for funerals, is now disused; in the
meadowed floor of the valley the Inn rests in quiet
reaches after its furious descent from the lakes; its
clear waters are joined by those of the Flaz from Val
Bernina, turbid with 'the dust of continents to be,'
and larger in volume than those of the stream in
which after their confluence its name and individuality
are lost; in the triangle between the rivers are the
Samaden golf links.  The most famous and fatal of
toboggan runs descends between St. Moritz and
Cresta.
</p>

<p>
Between Celerina and St. Moritz the rail threads
the romantic Charnadura gorge above the raging
Inn.  At the upper end is a fine fall by which the
water descends from the lake of St. Moritz, the
lowest of the chain of blue-green lakes that form
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P13"></a>13}</span>
the characteristic charm of the upper reaches of the
Engadine.
</p>

<p>
St. Moritz strikes one on arrival as a town of hotels.
Happily, hotels are becoming sensible that they
cannot afford to be unsightly outrages on the scenery
that is their <i>raison d'être</i>.  An example of this is the
Hôtel Margna, designed by Signur Nichol Hartmann,
in whom the Engadine possesses an architect imbued
with the spirit of its characteristic and picturesque
style of building, and with unfailing resource in
adapting it to modern requirements and utilizing old
construction.  'Only a matter of appearance,' said a
practical companion when I was hesitating to enter
a restaurant that disfigured a lovely nook of tarn and
fell.  It was said with a superior air of appealing to
higher considerations, much as Solomon, in extolling
the God-fearing woman, reminds us that favour is
deceitful and beauty is vain.  But, after all, what
is scenery save a matter of appearance?  In fact,
Switzerland lives on appearances, and it is but
business to take them into account in catering for the
thousands who are attracted thither, not by the
sterling virtues of the inhabitants, but by the superficial
beauty of the land.
</p>

<p>
St. Moritz, seated on a spur of hill at the head of
the lake, is the highest village in the Engadine, being
some 200 feet higher than the Maloja Pass at the
head of the valley.  At the highest point is the old
church, no longer used, whose interesting belfry seems
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P14"></a>14}</span>
leaning to its fall.  The inestimable Swiss periodical
<i>Heimatschutz</i> has pointed a salutary architectural
moral by presenting this neglected tower with its
simple proportions and vestiges of good work side by
side with the modern parish church, a painstaking
example of bad taste.
</p>

<p>
Beyond the old church the hill slopes up to the
Badrutt Park, named after a famous dynasty of
hoteliers.  Here is provision for golf, abounding in
speculative and absorbing contingencies.  In the larch
wood on the upper road from St. Moritz to Camfer
is the Segantini Museum, in which are gradually
being collected works of the painter who loved and
studied the Engadine with life-long devotion.
</p>

<p>
In the way of pictures, St. Moritz possesses a
treasure of the last kind one would look to find in a
mountain village.  In the Palace Hotel is&mdash;what shall
I say?&mdash;a copy, a replica, the original, for even that
claim has been made for it, of Raphael's Madonna di
S. Sisto, assuredly the noblest presentment of motherhood
that the world can show.  By a happy inspiration
it has been placed in the Ladies' Room, where it
must awaken a <i>Magnificat</i> in many a heart.
</p>

<p>
Apart from technique, there are slight but unmistakable
differences between it and its famous compeer
at Dresden.  In the Madonna's gaze is less of wonder
and amazement, something reaching far into futurity,
assurance of final triumph and disdain of intermediate
obstacle; not yet had the sword that should go through
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P15"></a>15}</span>
her soul set its sign on the young mother's face.
In the Child the difference is in an opposite sense; in
both pictures there is the same wonderful suggestion
of the awakening of the divine spirit amid the strange
limitations of humanity, but here it is rather the
human pathos than the divine power that holds our
attention; there is less imperial moulding of brow
and mouth, less profound mastery in the eyes: the
eyes to which all things were open but which saw
them now as man sees, appear contemplating with
perplexed wonder the path that was to be trodden&mdash;he
had known it all along, but it looked so different
now.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
In the flat land at the head of the lake, a little
more than a mile from St. Moritz, and linked to it by
an electric tramway, are the famous chalybeate
springs, round which has grown up the cluster of
buildings known as St. Moritzbad.  About half-way
down, on the larch-clad slope that rises to the right
of the road, is the Museum Engiadinais, the charming
building in old Engadine styles in which Signur
Hartmann has housed the magnificent collection of
Rhaetian antiquities made by Signur Campell of
Celerina.  To speak of this museum as a collection
of antiquities gives a very inadequate notion of its
interior.  Whole rooms, halls and corridors have been
installed there, and, combined with the old styles of
the building and the furniture and surroundings of
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P16"></a>16}</span>
old life, make wandering about it like an excursion
into the past.
</p>

<p>
A little farther on is the Anglican church, a
massive little building in the grey-green gabbro of the
neighbourhood.  The tower seems to have been suggested
by that of the half-ruined church of San Gian,
an assimilation of local style that cannot be too
highly commended.  An English church on the
Continent, like the Englishman himself, his clubs,
customs, and amusements, is apt to have an air of
extraterritoriality.  Who has not felt a shock on
revisiting some beloved mountain haunt to find that
since he was last there the church of his fathers,
looking as though it had just stepped from a suburb of
London, had added its note of incongruity to those
that hotels and bazaars had accumulated on the
devoted spot?
</p>

<p>
The chalybeate waters of St. Moritz have been
known from early times.  In addition to the original
spring there are now two others, one of which wells
up in the bed of the Inn.  Bubbles of carbonic acid
gas that rise to the surface of the lake where the river
enters it are thought to indicate another spring below;
in fact, the whole mass of crystalline rock that rises
into the peaks of Rosatz and Ova Cotschna is probably
a vast laboratory, in which the water that falls
from heaven and filters down to the river and the
lake is charged with healing virtues.

PIZ ALBANA AND PIZ JULIER IN WINTER.
</p>

<p>
Its efficacy, no doubt, is largely due to the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P17"></a>17}</span>
co-operation of the air, and to the ample provision made
for the comfort and distraction of health-seekers.
Sportsmen, artists, naturalists, and whatnot find
wherewithal to occupy them, while those who wish to
lounge and dream, who are content for a while simply
to exist, have environment to their hearts' content:
sleeping lakes and leaping streams, slopes of pasture
starred with flowers, solemn sanctuaries of forest,
wildernesses filled with the large companionable
loneliness of the hills.  And all this enchantment shines
in the rare mountain air with a vividness that seems
scarcely real.  Indeed, it is hard to set limits to
the many and magical effects of altitude on body and
spirit.  Though there may be no theological ground
for the statement by which it is said encouragement
is sometimes given to invalids at St. Moritz that in
the worst event they are nearer heaven than in any
other health resort of Europe; yet, short of that
unnegotiable contingency, there are undoubted
advantages at 6,000 feet above the sea not to be found
at lower levels.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Two roads, one from the village and one from
the baths, and numerous paths, direct and digressive,
lead from St. Moritz to Camfer, standing on the
uppermost of the three rocky steps that divide the
Upper Engadine into as many lake-basins.  The upper
lake has been divided into three by detritus brought
down from the Val Fex at Sils and from the Julier
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P18"></a>18}</span>
and Surlej at Silvaplana, the mid-lake at St Moritz
has shrunk to a remnant of its former self, while the
lower lake has entirely disappeared, tapped by the
gorge that the Inn has cut from the Upper to the
Lower Engadine.
</p>

<p>
The origin of such lakes has long been a problem.
The most authoritative conclusion seems to be that
in the slow tectonic wrinkling of the earth's crust
bars have been raised across the course of a river,
which has thus been dammed up into a lake and
drowned its former bed.  Of course, a crustal
subsidence might have had the same effect, or the two
movements may have been combined.
</p>

<p>
A mile and a half beyond Camfer is Silvaplana,
seated on the green promontory by which the
silt of the Ova del Vallun descending from the
Julier Pass, seconded on the opposite side by
streams from the Surlej, has cut the original lake
in two.  A picturesque wooden bridge spans the
channel still left to the Inn between the deltas
of its furious tributaries; in the background rises
Piz Margna, a glacier filling the cleft in its broad
head.
</p>

<p>
The sylvan shades commemorated in the name of
Silvaplana have long given place to flowery meadows,
which now cover the broad holm that the Ova del
Vallun has thrust into the lake.  High above the
village the vehement stream is commandeered for the
electrical supply of the valley.  By the side of the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P19"></a>19}</span>
works is a water-wheel, the earliest and the latest
harnessing of water-power, a striking illustration of
the return of industry to its oldest helpmate.  It will
be a curious instance of history repeating itself if
manufactures again plant themselves by streams as in
the days before water-wheels were superseded by
steam.  Population may one day be as congested in
the beautiful highlands that are now the playground
of the nations as in the great coal-basins.  Happily
the 'white coal,' as the Swiss call their water-power,
deals more sympathetically with nature than the
black.  What a contrast to our factories and gasworks
is this trim little building at Silvaplana, with its
aqueduct of ruddy larch, and the fine cascade from
the overflow of its reservoir.  It is as though the
grimy palm of Vulcan were replaced by the light
finger of Apollo.
</p>

<p>
The <i>raison d'être</i> of Silvaplana was the Julier Pass.
Before the construction of the railway, this was a
frequent route for entering the Engadine, which
makes a much more striking first impression here
than from the Albula.  After emerging from the grey
desolation of the two upper reaches of the descent,
a superb view of the Bernina peaks and the ice-fields
is gradually disclosed.  More and more the panorama
is extended to the right, first by the Fex peaks and
glaciers, and finally by the massive Margna.  The one
thing lacking is the Engadine; we seem to have
arrived in a land of serried and far-spread mountains,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P20"></a>20}</span>
in which there is no place for the valley of the Inn.
So precipitous are its sides at this point that no
suggestion is given of the broad lake-filled chasm
intervening between the immediate foreground and the
sombre rampart that rises to those glistening fields
and summits.  At length we are among the first
outposts of the forest, gaunt pines and battered larch,
scourged by centuries of storm; suddenly we see
through the foliage the glint of water and of verdure;
a moment after, and the lovely valley from Sils to
St. Moritz, with lakes and forests, meadows and
clustered homes, is stretched before us.
</p>

<p>
It is a pleasant walk from Silvaplana to the pass,
a broad saddle of bog and pasture, flecked with snow,
seamed with rivulets, and bright with abundant flora.
The tarns on the left are stocked with trout in spite
of being sealed with ice and buried in snow for half
the year.  A path from the dairy of the Julier Alp
takes us in three hours to the summit of the Piz
Julier, where, 'walled by wide air and roofed by
boundless heaven,' we have an extensive and splendid
view.
</p>

<p>
Another delightful walk from Silvaplana, as from
most places in the Upper Engadine, is to the Fuorcla
Surlej.  This saddle between Piz Corvatsch and Munt
Arias is equally accessible from Silvaplana, Sils,
St. Moritz, and Pontresina; it thus affords a pleasant
way of going from any place in the main valley to
the Bernina side-valley.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P21"></a>21}</span>
</p>

<p>
The road up the valley from Silvaplana lies straitly
between the left shore of the lake and the mountains
that rise precipitously from it.  Walkers will do well,
after Camfer, to take the path that skirts the lakes
on the right side of the valley, every step of which is
beautiful.  It leads now under shady trees, now over
parklike or rock-strewn slopes; picks its way along
precipitous hillsides, amid many-hued crags, set with
steadfast-rooted pine and larch, festooned with red
roses, inlaid with dwarf rhododendron, blue clematis,
and countless lovely flowers; occasionally may be
found masses of the rare and stately Alpine columbine.
On the right are the ever-changing waters of the lakes,
or the flat, emblossomed meadows that separate them.
</p>

<p>
Not quite three miles from Silvaplana the high-road
passes the little hamlet of Sils Baselgia, so called
from the ancient church, the basilica of the neighbourhood,
that stands, 'a grief-worn memory of old years,'
in a flat meadow by the tranquil Inn.
</p>

<p>
Past and present are delightfully merged in Signur
Badrutt's Hôtel Margna on the right of the hamlet,
an admirable example of an hotel in the traditional
architecture of the region, and in harmony with the
scenery around it.  Nichol Hartmann was given a free
hand with a characteristically massive and picturesque
old Engadine house, which he restored, enlarged, and
fitted with every modern comfort and convenience,
but with unfailing antiquarian feeling; old features
have been piously preserved, and their spirit carried
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P22"></a>22}</span>
into the new construction, with infinite ingenuity and
down to the smallest detail.
</p>

<p>
About half an hour farther from the high-road,
Sils Maria nestles cosily in a recess of the valley
behind a rocky hill, which rises as an island from
the flat meadows that have supplanted the lake.
</p>

<p>
Val Fex, which stretches up some five miles to the
south-east, is perhaps the most beautiful of the
side-valleys of the Engadine.  From the sunny
breakfast-cloisters of the Hôtel Margna we see its widespread
glacier sagging between the Capütschin and Piz Led,
as it were a great white sheet let down from heaven.
This forms the background of Plate IV., with the
picturesque little chapel that stands on the steep
meadow slope between the first and second reaches of
the valley in the foreground.  On either side of the
glacier interesting passes lead to Chiesa in the
beautiful Val Malenco, and thence down to Sondrio, the
capital of the Valtelline; in a few hours we exchange
ice-bound heights, sombre pines, and cautious,
close-growing Alpine flora for umbrageous groves, trellised
vines, and the luxurious breezes of the south.
</p>

<p>
Various points in the great rocky down that
separates the Fex and Fedoz valleys afford fine views.
We look down the whole chain of the lakes, seeming
masses of turquoise in an emerald setting; on the
right the Val Fex mounts to its glacier with crowded
peaks beyond; on the left is the wild ravine of the
Fedoz, the billowy ice-field at its head descending in
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P23"></a>23}</span>
a crumpled and crevassed glacier, beyond which a
host of rocky peaks ring round the abyss of blue haze
that covers the steep descent into Italy.
</p>

<p>
On the opposite side of the Val Fex is Marmorè,
another fine point of view.  An interesting continuation
of this walk leads to the savage amphitheatre
round the little Lej Sgrischus, 'the shuddering lake.'  This
lonely tarn, 8,695 feet above the sea, frozen for
nine months of the year, abounds in trout, a striking
instance of the hardiness of these redoubtable little fish.
How they came there is a problem; if introduced
by human enterprise it must have been centuries ago
as the renting of the fish-take is of ancient date.
</p>

<p>
A delightful place in which to pass a lazy hour
or so is the narrow promontory of Chastè, which
stretches half a mile into the lake in front of Sils
Baselgia.  Couched in springy undergrowth amid
larch-clad rocks and patches of beflowered meadow,
we are filled with a great content; the eye is satisfied
with seeing and the ear with hearing; the ripples lap
against the craggy shore, streams hum in the great
mountain that rises like a wall beyond the streak of
water, birds twitter amid the whispering leaves, the
earth seems flooded with a vast, satisfying murmur
that

helpless in the cruel grip of idiosyncrasy, who frequently
sought to cool life's fitful fever in this lovely spot.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
The charming path runs along the right shore
of the lake past the picturesque hamlet of Isola,
slumbering on its green promontory by the rush
and roar of the tumultuous Fedoz.  As the path
approaches it along the cliff its lichen-gilt stone roofs,
nestling close together, form a delightful mass of rich
colour.  These slices of mica-schist that render roofs
such a pleasing feature in the Engadine are mostly
quarried in the neighbouring Val Fex.  Behind Isola
the Fedoz descends in a fine fall, bringing material
for the delta that bids fair one day to cut the lake in
two.  In the village is an interesting old tavern,
formerly a country seat of the Vertimati; the fittings
and furniture are quite a study in woodwork.
</p>

<p>
A little farther on is a block of breccia inscribed to
the memory of Thomas Henry Huxley, who spent
many summers at Maloja.  Then, at the head of the
lake, we pass some fine ice-smoothed rocks and
ice-borne boulders, and arrive at the pleasant space
between the lake and the descent towards Italy that
goes by the name of Maloja, a name that strictly
belongs to its western edge, the nearest approach to
a terminal pass that the truncated valley of the Inn
presents.
</p>

<br>

<br>
VAL FEX.
</p>

<p>
Unfortunately for the first impression of Maloja,
the most salient object is the huge bulk of the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P25"></a>25}</span>
Kursaal, grotesquely incongruous with its surroundings.
Behind it are the golf links, bristling with attractive
difficulties and deceptions.  Above them is the English
church, so light and graceful a little structure
that it would be captious to object that though it be
Swiss it is not Engadine, and on a hillock opposite
the Roman Catholic church.  In the grounds of the
Hôtel Belvedere are impressive records of ice action,
including some fine glacier-cauldrons.
</p>

<p>
It is a pleasant walk along the romantic ravine of
the Ordlegna and by the Lago di Cavloccio to the
Forno club hut.  A digression on the right soon after
starting leads to the little Lago di Bitabergo (shown
on the cover) amid rocks and sombre forests, a
beautiful and sequestered spot.
</p>

<p>
Those who have followed up the Inn from the
beautiful mountain-girt capital of Tirol, which is
named from bridging it, will not willingly forgo a
pilgrimage to the little Lago di Lunghino, which is
its reputed source.  It is an imposing cradle for a
great river, lying under a sheer wall of rock that
rises into stony spires.  The little stream escapes
from its austere birthplace under a bridge of frozen
snow, and flings itself, wild and white, down the steep
descent to its lakes.  In the first instance it was
probably one of the most modest affluents of the stream
it is now taken to represent.  Both its slender volume
and the fact that its direction is different to that of
the Inn preclude its being considered in any real
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P26"></a>26}</span>
sense the source of the great stream that hollowed
the Engadine, which now lies a truncated trough with
no terminal amphitheatre.  The original source and
all the upper affluents of this mighty river that rolled
to the Black Sea have long since been captured by
the Maira and diverted to the Mediterranean.  If we
walk up the neighbouring Piz Lunghino we shall
look down on the field of that long battle of the
waters.  It is the most striking example to be found
of the slow but steady encroachment of the southern
streams that is going on all along the Alps.  The
more abrupt slope on the south gives the water
greater erosive force, with the result that it is
continually eating back into the range and thrusting the
watershed to the north.  Nowhere has this result
been so extensive and startling as in the region
below us.*
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="footnote">
* The remarkable record of this physiographical change preserved
in the present flora of the valley is noticed in the chapter
on botany in 'Upper Engadine.'
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Heim, a great authority, thinks that the original
source of the great river that carved the Engadine
was some seven or eight miles away in the Val
Marozzo, which now passes for the head of the Val
Bregaglia, whose normal direction seems thus reversed.
The main water-shed of the Alps must then, he thinks,
have lain along a transverse ridge somewhere above
Vicosoprano.  The head waters of the Maira gradually
ate through this and, by offering to those of the Inn
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P27"></a>27}</span>
a more rapid descent, captured them for the Mediterranean.
The Engadine lakes were thus bereft of their
parent source; the current from the rivulet of the
Lunghino tarn was quite unequal to sweeping down
the detritus brought by its furious affluents, which
were thus free to form the deltas that are gradually
filling the lakes, whose fate, happily remote, would
seem to be to disappear.
</p>

<p>
What changes, one wonders, are still to come?
How long will the solid peak beneath us withstand
the continual flux?  As one gazes on the 'sea of
mountains' stretching on every side, a new aptness
is given to the hackneyed figure.  For seeing
everywhere below the flash of cataracts and the riot of
descending streams, with the murmur in the air of
innumerable waters all incessantly engaged in the
work of transformation, the everlasting hills seem
mutable as the waves of ocean:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  The hills are shadows, and they flow<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From form to form, and nothing stands:<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They melt like mists the solid lands,<br>
  Like clouds they shape themselves and go.<br>

<h3>
II
<br><br>
VAL BERNINA
</h3>

<p>
Val Bernina, the most notable of the side-valleys of
the Engadine, is traversed by the railway that runs
from St. Moritz to Tirano in the Valtelline.  This is
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P28"></a>28}</span>
joined by the Rhaetian Railway from Samaden at
Pontresina, the pleasant collective name of the three
villages&mdash;Laret, Spiert, and Giarsun&mdash;that stretch in
a long street at the entrance to the valley, happier
than most resorts in the Engadine in enjoying
magnificent views of the great snow mountains.
</p>

<p>
Of course, like all popular resorts, Pontresina pays
the penalty of being appreciated.  Those who gibe at
the Upper Engadine as a transcendent tea-garden
have a special gibe for Pontresina.  But the garden
is so very transcendent, so lovely, so extended, so
varied, so full of retreats of wild, sweet beauty, so
continually rising into points of view whence one
looks illimitably across the high places of the earth,
that the term is freed from all opprobrium.
</p>

<p>
Seldom do crowded places have within a few
minutes of them such attractive haunts as the
Schlucht promenade along the left bank of the deep
ravine of the Bernina.  The many-hued cliffs grasped
by the snaky roots of straight-stemmed firs are writ
with records of the stream's former course: the curve
of waterfalls; the winding, widening, and narrowing
of its channel; the swirl and sweep of its current; the
deep holes ground by stones revolving in its eddies,
as it gradually wore down its bed to that along which
it now frets and fumes, incessantly bearing away the
substance of staid and sober Switzerland to make
land for the restless peoples of the Danube and the
Black Sea.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P29"></a>29}</span>
</p>

<p>
The great points of view are on the other side.
The most famous is the Piz Languard, reached by a
beautiful walk.  Another is the Muotlas Muraigl to
which we may mount by a cable railway from the
station of Punt Muraigl at the junction of the lines
from Samaden and St. Moritz.  Hence we have a
splendid prospect: in front lie the Upper Engadine
lakes, like successive reaches of a broad blue river;
to the right is the pinnacled ridge of the lower Julier
range; to the left the Rosegg valley, with the glaciers
and peaks at its head; still more to the left the view
in Plate I., the steep northern slope of the Chalchaign,
and the shining summits and far-flung snows
of the Bellavista, Palü, and Cambrena peaks.
</p>

<p>
Fine, too, is the prospect from the Schaffberg, where
is a memorial to Giovanni Segantini, who for some
time before his death was occupied in painting this
magnificent view.  Here, one winter day in 1899, he
succumbed, in face of the great landscape that had
cast its spell on him.
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Could kindliest fortune fairer parting send?<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
The Rosegg and Morteratsch glaciers are
Pontresina's two main entrances to the high Alpine
world, that radiant world which lies so near us in the
Upper Engadine, yet seems as far from soil and smirch
of lower earth as though it had just descended out of
heaven from God.  Plate V. gives the former: in front
is the pleasant, primitive little inn; beyond it the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P30"></a>30}</span>
glacier, for a long time receding, has left the usual mean
and desolate disorder; farther are the combined glaciers
of the Rosegg and Tschierva; between them is the
rocky Aguagliouls, a curious reserve of vegetable life
on which, it is said, two hundred different specimens
of plants have been counted; in the height of summer
sheep are driven across the glacier to graze there; in
the background, from right to left, are the Caputschin
and Mongia peaks, the broad gap of the Fuorcla
Glüschaint, the Piz Glüschaint, the double summit of
la Sella, and, hidden in the clouds, Piz Rosegg.
</p>

<p>
The Morteratsch glacier is Pontresina's other
gateway to the great white world.  The railway has a
station within a short distance of it.  A path mounts
hence to the beautiful series of falls by which the
Bernina descends among purple rocks from the upper
reach of its valley.  About a mile after this path joins
the high-road are the three quaint Bernina Houses, a
typical old mountain inn, evidently prepared to be
buried in snow through the winter.  Behind them
stands Piz Alv, a huge bare cone of limestone, sole
memorial of the teeming life of the sea that once
covered the granite and schist around.  A striking
contrast to its dusty bareness is the ruddy granite
of the neighbouring Piz Lagalb, clothed with hardy
vegetation.
</p>

<p>
Continuing on the almost level road, we pass the
Lej Minvir, then the Lej Nair, 'black lake,' the
waters of which, filtered through peat, are of an inky
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P31"></a>31}</span>
purple.  Separated from it by a few yards of pasture,
and in such sharp contrast of colour as to seem
almost unreal, is the Lej Alv, 'white lake,' filled by
the turbid stream from the Cambrena glacier with
greenish-white water.  The contrast is said to be
reproduced in the trout abounding in them, which are
of a dark and light colour respectively.  This narrow
neck of bog and pasture is the watershed between the
Inn descending to the Black Sea, and the Adda to the
Mediterranean; occasionally, it is said, a wind from
the south or east, funnelled and furious in the pass,
drives the white waters over into the black, and
temporarily unites the lakes.  Presumably at such
times the white trout lie low, or the distinction
between the two breeds would have been lost.
</p>

<p>
The Bernina Hospice is finely posted above Lej
Alv.  Hence the road on the left, and the rail and an
enchanting footpath on the right, descend by the
lovely Lago di Poschiavo to Italy.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
A return to Pontresina may be made by the
popular 'Diavolezza Tour.'  Plate VI. gives a
fine suggestion of the scenery at its highest point,
the little inn attractively entitled 'Zum Ewigen
Schnee' in the foreground, Piz Palü beyond.
Hence we descend to the Pers glacier, thread
our way among its shafts and pinnacles, one of the
most striking and beautiful mazes of ice formation
that I know; rest awhile on the rocks of Isola Persa;
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P32"></a>32}</span>
and finally pass over the broad, billowy Morteratsch
glacier and follow its right lateral moraine to the
hotel-restaurant set in front of one of the stateliest
pageants of the Alps.  I wish the artist had been
moved to give a sketch of it, but he was probably
there in conditions that made sketching impossible.
Most persons know the place as a maddening babel.
All day long trains, vans, and lesser vehicles
discharge their close-packed occupants, and a stream of
pedestrians pass through on their way up or down
the valley.  But one summer evening I arrived there
from over the glacier after walking from early dawn;
the last sightseer had gone; I had my supper at
a little table on the greensward between the larch
wood and the rushing stream, in front of me the
majestic Piz Palvi, set on high in the lingering light
like the great white throne of the Apocalypse; it
seemed a divinely peaceful spot, such as may have
been that garden of the early world where God
walked in the cool of the day.

<br><br>
SUOT FONTANA MERLA
</h3>

<p>
From old time this has been the designation of the
dozen miles of the Upper Engadine below Bevers.
Three-quarters of a mile down a lonely little tavern,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P33"></a>33}</span>
las Agnas, marks the most historic spot in the valley.
Here, on the 7th of May, 1462, representatives of all
the communes assembled and settled the constitution
and the administrative and judicial organization of the
little political unit that federated with others into the
Free State of the Three Leagues, and here from time
to time they long continued to meet in council.  In
the adjoining meadow of las Islas all men who could
bear arms mustered in May, 1499, elected Thomas
Planta as their bannerman, and marched down to
join the forces of the Three Leagues at Zuoz, and
bear their part at Calven on that bloody Easter
Monday that won the independence of the land.
Near by is the intermittent spring of Fontana Merla,
the Merles' Well, the immemorial boundary between
the two administrative divisions of the valley, sur
e suot, above and below, Fontana Merla.

<p>
We then come to Ponte, with many interesting
old houses, and then to Madulein, a name that is said
to have no connection with Magdalen, while the
etymology that derives it from <i>medio-lacu</i> is probably
little more than a pun on some far older name rooted
in a forgotten tongue.  The fact, however, that the
derivation was current some centuries ago is interesting
as suggesting that there may then have survived
some strand of tradition stretching back to the time
when a remnant of the lake that must once have
covered this reach of the valley still existed.  On a
rocky spur of mountain above Madulein are the ruins
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P34"></a>34}</span>
of Guardaval, erected in 1251 by Bishop Conrad,
'the castle lover.'
</p>

<p>
Here and there homely potato-plots and patches
of oats and rye give sign that the severity of the high
Alpine climate is mitigating.  On the left opens out
the pleasant Val d'Eschia, carved by water from the
glaciers that imbed the four rocky peaks of the Kesch,
shown in Plate VII.  Before us is Piz d'Eren, a great
cone of limestone capped with snow.  The valley
widens and, clustering round a tall spire on a broad
slope of meadow, we see the close-packed houses of
Zuoz.
</p>

<p>
When, at the commencement of the sixteenth
century, the villages of the Upper Engadine rose from
the ashes to which the devoted patriotism of their
inhabitants had consigned them&mdash;a devotion that
saved the whole Leagueland&mdash;Zuoz was by common
consent the chief among them, and all the leading
families built residences there.
</p>

<p>
On entering the village we see the interesting
Chesa Gregori-Gilli, dated 1551.  On its front are the
Rhaetian wildman and St. George, with the inscription
'Evviva la Grischa,' followed by a precept that
at some periods of its history la Grischa has sadly
needed 'Res parva concordia crescit, maximæ
discordia dilabuntur.'  In the central square is a fine
house of the Plantas.  On the neighbouring Tuor
Planta an inscription records that it was destroyed by
fire in 1499 through the patriotic self-sacrifice
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P35"></a>35}</span>
mentioned above, and here again is an exhortation to
dwell together in unity.
</p>

<br>
<img class="imgcenter" src="images/img-035.jpg" alt="'SUM EWIGEN SCHNEE'">
<br>
'SUM EWIGEN SCHNEE'
</p>

<p>
These inscriptions point the moral of the municipal
history of Zuoz.  Nowhere raged more fiercely the
fire of faction that in the sixteenth and seventeenth
centuries bid fair to bring to naught the independence
that the heroism of a nobler generation had so hardly
won.  Yet a saving seed was left.  The picturesque
Chesa Juvalta, which preserves many portraits of past
Juvaltas in the next village of S-chanf,* recalls the
pleasing legend that when the insanity of civil strife
was at its highest, and the streets of Zuoz were red
with the blood of its citizens, the women of the town,
headed by Anna Juvalta, threw themselves with tears
and prayers between the maddened combatants, and
declared that they should only strike one another by
passing over the bodies of their wives and daughters.
</p>

<p class="footnote">
* I will not attempt to phoneticize the peculiar <i>ch</i> of Romanic
orthography.  English spelling has been styled an invention of

Engadine place-names I have preferably used the native Ladin
form, except in the many cases where the German form seemed
naturalized in English.

Relentless criticism has, I believe, relegated Anna
to the limbo of unaccredited immortals that every day
becomes more crowded, but I trust it will be long
ere the souls of young Engadiners cease to be
nourished on the exploded legends of their country.
It matters little that they be not history.  There are
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P36"></a>36}</span>
legends that are truer than history in that they
embody the spirit without which the external facts of
history would not have been.  William Tell may not
have shot his arrow at Altorf, nor Anna Juvalta stood
between the armed ranks at Zuoz, but had there not
been many men and women of the temper of Tell and
Anna the Forest Cantons would still be ruled by
aliens, and Rhaetian independence would long ago
have foundered in anarchic bloodshed.
</p>

<p>
Zuoz and S-chanf have become of late years something
of an educational centre, and also a resort for
winter sports.  Zuoz has provided itself with a Kursaal,
which it terms Castell, a finely situated building
in good Engadine style designed by Nichol Hartmann.
Recent building in the district gives gratifying
evidence of the influence of the Heimatschutz, a league
for the preservation of old architecture, and the
assimilation of its styles and spirit in new construction.
</p>

<p>
Two miles below S-chanf is the hamlet of Capella,
so called from the chapel of St. Güerg of which but
a fragment remains.  Near it formerly stood an
enormous pine tree sacred to St. George, the patron of
the Upper Engadine, which was an object of profound
veneration throughout the valley.  When, on S-chanf
declaring for the Reformation, the aged tree was
felled, its fall was probably a greater wrench with the
past than any thesis or formula of faith.  What
echoes of old rites, what ghosts of forgotten creeds,
may have haunted the shade of its sombre foliage!
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P37"></a>37}</span>
That its sacred character was originally connected
with St. George is most unlikely; it was more probably
a relic of a faith and worship to which St. George
was as of yesterday, and which primitive Christianity
recognized as too deeply rooted in the popular
imagination to be lightly discarded.  There was a large
humanity in those early missionaries that went for
much in their success.  They would not rudely cut
away props on which men's souls had leaned, but left
them to stand while they might, consecrated to a
new significance.  Some better thing might be
reserved for the succeeding time, but without them it
was not to be made perfect.
</p>

<p>
Soon after this the road crosses the Sulsanna,
coming from its cascaded valley, and the changing
character of the scenery ahead reminds us that we are
nearing the end of the upper valley of the Inn.  A
mile beyond Capella, in a green basin below the road,
is Sinuos-chel, the last hamlet, a few picturesque
houses, one of them quaintly frescoed, with a demure
little church.  The valley narrows to a ravine; the
Inn whitens to a torrent as it rages down the gorge
that it has cut for itself through the bar of schist that
once dammed it into a lake; two bridges, one in
stone upon the present road, the other the historic
wooden Punt Ota on the grass-grown road above,
span the foaming yellow brook that is the
immemorial boundary of the Upper Engadine.

IV
<br><br>
THE LOWER ENGADINE
</h3>

<p>
The division of the Engadine into Upper and Lower
is not a piece of arbitrary map-making.  We seem to
pass into a new country when, leaving the broad
upper valley, lying wide-stretched to the sky, where
only human supervision prevents the Inn spreading
out into lakes and marshes, we go down into the deep
trough bordered by picturesque peaks and ridges,
where the river that has so long been the companion
of the road flows far below it between steep walls of
rock.  And not only does the scenery change, but the
climate, the flora, the very dialect of the people and
their character in history is different.
</p>

<p>
Descending from the Punt Ota to the roofed
wooden bridge that takes us to the right bank of the
Inn, we are hemmed in by heights in a land of
clamant streams.  The sombre severity of Upper Engadine
scenery is broken into a romantic variety of detail:
austere masses of mountain give place to splintered
peaks and ragged ridges, their sides are more
furrowed, a luxuriant forest vegetation clothes their
steeper slopes, and the meadows on the gentler slopes
are more interspersed with tilth.
</p>

<br>
PIZ KESCH FROM THE SERTIG PASS.
</p>

<p>
The first village is Zernez, spread on a flat green
widening of the valley, the slender spire and frescoed
walls of its church standing on a little eminence
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P39"></a>39}</span>
beside it.  The church and a few picturesque old
houses are all that escaped a fire that destroyed the
rest of the village in 1872.
</p>

<p>
A beautiful railway route runs hence by the Fuorn
Pass, the Val Mustair, and the Stelvio road under the
dazzling snows of the Ortler, to Trafoi in Austria.
Soon after passing the frontier is the defile of Calven,
where on Easter Monday, 1499, eight thousand hastily
mustered men of the lately formed Leagues attacked
and routed a strongly entrenched and well equipped
Imperial army of nearly double their number, a brilliant
feat of arms that laid the foundation of Rhaetian
independence.*  For about four miles of its course
the railway passes through the National Park; a
clause in the agreement between the Confederation
and the commune of Zernez permits quarrying and
wood-cutting for its construction and upkeep in the
sequestrated region.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="footnote">
* I have described this remarkable little war at greater
length in 'The Upper Engadine,' pp. 9-20.
</p>

<p><br><br></p>

<p>
For a couple of miles road and river thread a pine-clad
gorge in which the normally longitudinal valley
of the Inn becomes transverse; before us towers the
huge Piz Linard, posted in front of and dominating
the vast Silvretta maze of fell and glacier.  Then
another widening of the valley gives standing ground
for the picturesque village of Susch; an ancient tower
rises by the quaint minaret of its church; on a
wooded hill beside it is one of the many 'chiefless
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P40"></a>40}</span>
castles breathing stern farewell' that add a note of
historical romance to the scenery of the Engadine.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
In the Lower Engadine the valley of the Inn
seldom widens into a flat floor as at Zernez.  On the
right it for the most part rises precipitously, giving
little footing for building and cultivation.  Thus
habitation has always been mainly on the sunny
slopes and terraces that look south on the left.  At
Lavin, two miles below Susch, walkers can take the
old road that runs on this side, high above the new,
by the shells and towers of old castles, and commanding
lovely views.  Lavin, Guarda, and Ardez are
known as the Etruscan villages; I believe they have
not an even colourable claim to the appellation,
which, however, is of old date, and has given rise to
much ingenious diversion in providing etymologies
for place-names in the neighbourhood.  The villages,
however, have an idyllic charm from their quaint
old houses and lovely situation that has no need to
borrow interest from factitious history or philology.
Guarda, on an open terrace at the entrance to Val
Tuoi, is perhaps the most frequented as a summer
resort.  Its neighbourhood affords rambles to suit all
tastes, from mountaineering to dawdling, with special
attractions in Val Tuoi for the botanic dawdler.
</p>

<p>
At Ftan, delightfully placed on an undulating
terrace some 1,500 feet above the Inn, we enter a
region impregnated with mineral waters and gases of
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P41"></a>41}</span>
singular potency, where thousands of sufferers from
various ills that flesh is heir to are yearly gathered.
It is claimed that no other district in Europe is so
rich in therapeutic waters.
</p>

<p>
The springs, which issue with a temperature a little
over 60° F., are all strongly acidulated, and though
varying a good deal in their constituents and in the
proportions in which they are mixed, fall broadly into
two classes: Glauber's salts (sulphate, carbonate, and
chloride of sodium) and chalybeate or iron.  They
are good for both drinking and bathing; the large
proportion of carbonic acid gas with which they are
charged is said to render them peculiarly efficacious
in baths.  An interesting evidence of the plutonic
character of the neighbourhood are the mofette, vents
in the earth from which carbonic acid gas issues in
considerable quantity.  One in a field near Scuol, in
which unwary birds, lizards, and insects are frequently
done to death, has been estimated to discharge eleven
million litres a day.
</p>

<p>
The centres of the little invalid world are the
Kurhaus and Trinkhalle, emparadised in beautiful
gardens on the left and right banks of the Inn
respectively, and connected by a roofed bridge.
Both sides of the valley bristle with hotels for
the accommodation of patients: Scuol on an open
terrace on the left with magnificent views, and
Vulpera ensconced among woods and meadows on
the right.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P42"></a>42}</span>
</p>

<p>
The region takes its name Tarasp, <i>terra aspera</i>,
from the castle, which stands on a hill of splintered
rock some distance from the principal springs.  On
the hillside is the hamlet of Sparsels, with a curious
fountain-shrine; and below, by a little lake, Fontana,
with the parish church and a Capuchin hospice, for,
owing to the long tenure of the seigniory by Austria,
this commune, alone in the Engadine, has remained
Catholic.  In the eleventh century, after long
disputes, the castle and seigniory became vested in the
bishopric of Chur.  In 1239 they passed to the
counts of Tirol, and remained Austrian till, by the
Treaty of Luneville in 1801, they were made over to
Graubünden as a set-off to various fiefs of the
bishopric of Chur scattered in the Vorarlberg and Tirol.
There are enchanting views of this loveliest nook of
the Lower Engadine from the windows of the castle,
whose latest purchaser is the ex-Grand-Duke of
Hesse.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Descending the valley, we pass the ruin of the
Romanesque church of St. Peter on a rocky hill.
Then the villages of Sent and Crusch, 'The Cross,' a
little below which a road crosses the Inn to Sur En
on the right bank at the opening of the sequestered
Val d'Uina.
</p>

<p>
About a mile and a half below Crusch is the deep
ravine through which the Sinestra flows to the Inn.
On a rocky hill above is the ruined castle of Tschanuf,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P43"></a>43}</span>
the seat till the beginning of last century of an
episcopal castellan who controlled the jurisdiction of the
Lower Engadine.  Less than an hour up the wild and
lovely Val Sinestra are some famous springs impregnated
with iron, arsenic, and other minerals, and
highly charged with carbonic acid gas.  Centuries
before the present high-road and Kurhaus facilitated
access to and use of them, their virtues were known
in the Engadine and Tirol, and a little band of
sufferers flocked yearly to this secluded glen, living
in tents while they drank the waters and bathed with
pristine simplicity under a spreading elder tree in
troughs in which the water was warmed by heated
stones.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Descending the Inn Valley we come to Ramuosch
in a fertile nook of ancient cultivation.  Its
interesting church, which formerly claimed to
enshrine the wonder-working remains of St. Florin,
was long a place of pilgrimage both for Engadiners
and Tirolese.  Though the saint was priest of
Ramuosch, his birthplace was Matsch in Tirol,
and every year on his festival the chest that was
believed to hold his bones was carried in solemn
procession from Ramuosch to Matsch, some eight
hours distant, and back.  In 1530 it occurred to
the authorities of Ramuosch to open the chest,
which was found to contain nothing but rags.
Ramuosch was then halting at the crossways, and
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P44"></a>44}</span>
this cruel disillusion decided it for the Reformation.*
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="footnote">
* 'At the commencement of the great schism the Government
of the Three Leagues, after listening to incontrovertible
arguments on both sides in a theological conference at Ilanz in
January, 1526, decided to be perfectly neutral, leaving individual
consciences free, and allowing each commune to decide for itself
to which persuasion it would officially belong.  Thus the people
settled for themselves the question that concerned them so
deeply, which in the rest of Europe was mainly decided over
their heads by rulers often actuated by considerations far from
religious' ('Upper Engadine,' p. 168).
</p>

<p><br><br></p>

<p>
On the right below Ramuosch a fine waterfall
marks the entrance to the pent, pine-clad Val d'Assa.
In a cliff some two hours up is a stalactite cavern and
a spring known as Fontana chi staina, 'the spring
that stands still.'  Its final channel is probably a
natural siphon that empties a hidden reservoir three
times a day, and ceases to flow while it is refilling.
</p>

<p>
In a fertile widening of the Inn Valley is the village
of Strada and, perched high above, that of Tschlin.
Dark woods clothe the right bank of the Inn, now
swollen by the melting of many glaciers to a
considerable stream.  Then we come to Punt Martina, in
German Martinsbruck, standing amid grand scenery
at the end of the Engadine.  By the iron bridge
beyond it we pass into Tirol.  In front the road
winds up wooded slopes, and then climbs and cuts its
way among the slate rocks of the romantic Finstermünz
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P45"></a>45}</span>
Pass.  On the left a new road drops down
along the Swiss side of the Novella gorge to Alt
Finstermünz, far below, where antiquated fortifications
cling to the sheer cliffs, under which the
straitened stream flows swift and deep.  Old wooden
bridges from either jealous bank meet in the vaulted
gangway of a square tower set on a submerged rock
in midstream.

<br><br>
THE NATIONAL PARK
</h3>

<p>
This great reserve has added a unique attraction to
the Engadine.  The idea was for a long time the
aspiration of an elect few, leavening public opinion
and pestering the Government.  At last they had
their reward.  For years the authorities that in an
admirable reciprocity govern and are governed by
the population of Switzerland cautiously committed
themselves to the enterprise.  In 1906 they appointed
a Naturschutzkommission to report on a desirable
region to be sequestrated.  In 1909 a Naturschutzbund
was formed to supplement official efforts.  The
commission negotiated rights in first one fragment
then another of the selected and authorized area:
from the commune of Zernez in 1909 the Val Cluoza,
in 1910 the Val Tantermozza and the northern and
western slopes of Piz Esan; from the commune of
S-chanf in 1911 the southern slopes of Piz Esan and
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P46"></a>46}</span>
Piz Quatervals, the Val Muschauns, and part of the
right side of Val Trupchum; from the commune of
Scuol and the pastoral league of Tavrü most of the
east side of the S-charl district; from Zernez in 1913
the Praspol, Schera, and Stavelchod districts.  All
concessions were with option of renewal.  Right of
emption was also secured over the region linking the
two unequal areas into which the appropriations fall.
This is termed the Verbindungsgebiet, roughly
speaking the Val Nuglia, the upper Val Plavna, and the
heights bordering both.  In 1914 a resolution of the
Federal Council gave legislative seal to the transactions,
banning to human enterprise some fifty square
miles.  The addition of the linking domain will bring
the area up to about eighty square miles.  Of course,
the figures give the horizontal projection on the map;
the surface measurement would be considerably more,
as anyone who has had to do with real property that
is 'mostly on end' will realize.

SKETCH MAP SHOWING SWISS NATIONAL PARK.
</p>

<hr>

<p>
As to the locality of this forbidden land, public
opinion has unanimously endorsed the choice of the
commission.  In no part of Switzerland is there an
equal area that could be given over to untrammelled
natural agencies with so little social or economical
derangement.  It is wholly without permanent
human habitation, there is no tillage and but little
pasturage to be disestablished, while the hardly less
important Fremdenindustrie has barely touched the
hem of the great reserve, which boasts none of the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P48"></a>48}</span>
transcendent charm that has made the rest of
Switzerland the playground of Europe; with the exception
of a short reach below the Fuorn Pass, no rail or
post-road threads its savage solitudes, it cradles no
enchanting lake, it enshrines no soaring peaks or shining
glaciers, its valleys, which enjoy such uninviting
names as Val del Diavel, Sassa, Cluoza, Nuglia,
Sainza bon (I will not insult the reader's ingenuity by
translating them), though full of wild charm, are
little haunted by artist and photographer;
wood-cutting, hunting, and scanty and sporadic pasturage
are the only industries that will be interfered with.
This unkempt, unused wilderness at the eastern edge
of the Confederation has the further recommendation
that, partly from this isolation and neglect, partly
from lying on the borderland of distinct botanic
zones, it exhibits a varied and comprehensive flora,
and has given asylum to sundry odds and ends of
vanishing fauna.
</p>

<p>
Though, following precedent elsewhere, the term
'reserve,' which was first employed for the
sequestrated area, has officially given place to that of
National Park, the former better expresses the aim of
the scheme.  The proposed object of such sequestration
in other countries has been public enjoyment,
but this is only incidentally an object of the Swiss
enterprise, which is rather a great scientific
experiment in the interplay of unimpeded natural agencies.
Nature is to be given a free hand, and man, his hands
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P49"></a>49}</span>
behind his back, will look on and see what she
makes of it.
</p>

<p>
Of course, the field of unsophisticated nature is
not, when closely looked at, the peaceful paradise
dreamed by the artless philosophy of a century ago.
The beneficent mother pictured by sentimental
idealists has been revealed to these latter days as a
soulless monster, red in tooth and claw with ravin,
working blindly under the impulsion of inexorable
tendencies that know not truce nor ruth.  To make a
sanctuary where she shall have her way without let
or hindrance amounts to keeping the ring for a free
fight of flora and fauna, only the meddlesome hand
of her supreme masterpiece&mdash;whom it is rather
amusing we should exclude from our conception of
nature&mdash;being ruled out.
</p>

<p>
As regards flora, I believe the procedure has been
mainly thus to let things alone, but the administration
are introducing much that is new, or that has
disappeared, in the way of fauna.  To a large extent,
indeed, they have introduced themselves with that
telepathic percipience of a sanctuary so remarkable in
hunted creatures.  Already in October, 1913, a large
bear appeared in the Park.  Their former presence is
attested by sundry place-names&mdash;Val del Orso, Bagn
del Uors&mdash;and in the Val Cluoza and elsewhere old
timber bear-traps still stand.  Bears, however, are
too expensive guests to be welcomed.  Not sixty
years ago their ravages among sheep and cattle were
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P50"></a>50}</span>
still considerable, and the administration has engaged
with the neighbouring communes not to harbour
them.
</p>

<p>
A former denizen of the Alps whose successful
re-establishment has been hailed with universal
acclamation is the lordly ibex, or, as Engadiners
call it, the Capricorn (bouquetin, steinbock).
Throughout Switzerland there is a sentiment of
romance connected with this stately goat, who for
over three centuries has had only an heraldic
existence in his ancient fastnesses; his imperially
horned head is the emblem of the canton, and swings
as sign of innumerable inns; he capers amid thistles
on the seal of the commune of Zernez and prances
rampant on either side of armorial devices frescoed
on the walls of old houses.  In 1920 seven young
Capricorn were let loose in the Cluoza-Spol section,
and their number has increased in spite of foreign
marauders, but here we are on delicate ground, and it
is well to emulate the diplomatic reticence of the
Federal authorities.  The stock is to be reinforced
this year by a pair from the Zoological Gardens at
Interlaken.
</p>

<p>
The Park started with a good stock of chamois of
several types and some deer, and more have flocked
to it as the good news of a sanctuary was passed
round in ways that man knows not; in fact deer may
be said to have taken possession of the S-charl district.
Marmots abound, and will still more abound.  Moreover,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P51"></a>51}</span>
affiliated to the Park, the only patch of it on the
left of the Inn is a sanctuary established for the droll
little rodents on the Godgod slopes between S-chanf
and Capella well back in last century.  During the
construction of the railway the Italian workmen
wrought sad havoc among them with snares, which
they had become too confiding to avoid; but they
have since regained their paradise, and the discreet
wanderer may watch their engaging antics at work
and play.  Their surplus progeny is no doubt making
its own Verbindungsgebiet with the Park.
</p>

<p>
It must not be supposed, from what has been said,
that the great reserve is a forbidding region of interest
only to the naturalist.  It is replete with charm
and full of a variety that blends in wide harmonies, or
surprises with sudden contrasts; a region of still
forest sanctuaries, of wild ravines and savage gorges,
of eager streams flashing white in cascades and
torrents or rushing green and smooth in deep-worn beds;
of many-hued rocks piled in chaotic ruin or set
in mazy labyrinths or strewn splintered on the slopes;
lonely tarns shine on emerald uplands or sleep in
stony wildernesses; the lofty lawns are starred with
flowers and sentinelled with immemorial trees; in
sequestered dells rivulets wind and whisper amid
blossoming herbage, or creep and croon in leafy
coverts; great grey stones dream under the hoary
trees of Druidic glades; a land of pristine seclusion,
of gracious solitudes, of high, silent places where
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P52"></a>52}</span>
earth and heaven seem to meet.  And over all plays
the wizardry of the clear mountain air and the fleeting
mountain weather, weaving a glamour of shifting
splendour and gloom over peak and vale, stream and
forest, lighting the landscape into a prodigal enchantment
of detail or wrapping it in mystery and portent.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
In common with all who are interested in the
National Park, I am greatly indebted to Dr. Stefan
Brunies, Secretary and Treasurer of the Heimatschutz,
who has made the subject his own in various delightful
books replete with nature- and folk-lore.  Therein
are given a number of itineraries for exploring the
Park and studying its plants, birds, and beasts, in all
which the wanderer will find Dr. Brunies an invaluable
and entertaining companion.
</p>

<p>
S-chanf is, he thinks, the best starting-point for
traversing the Park.  Crossing the Inn by the Livigno
road, a path on the left crosses the Varusch stream
and follows up its right bank to Alp Purcher.  Here,
on the left, a path enters the Park, and runs up the
Alp Müschauns under the chasmed heights of Piz
Esan; on the steep grassy slopes below them the
practised eye will seldom fail to locate chamois
browsing.  Passing on the right a long narrow tarn fed by
a tongue of glacier we reach a low saddle that leads
into the appropriately named Val Sassa, in the steep
screes of which the path is lost till it reappears on
the broad valley floor, where, crossing a wooden
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P53"></a>53}</span>
bridge, we find, ensconced in dense forest, the Cluoza
blockhouse.
</p>

<p>
Here are eight beds and supplementary sleeping
accommodation on hay; the warder supplies meals at
a fixed tariff.  Chamois, and now and then deer, may
be marked on the slopes above, where salt-licks
have been placed for their delectation.  Any wayfarer
may pass two nights at the blockhouse in the
heart of the great reserve; for a longer stay authority
must be obtained from the Naturschutzkommission
at Bale.
</p>

<p>
We commence next day's walk by mounting
steeply on the east to the Murter Alp, a plateau of
flowery pasture buttressed round with precipices.
Here we have a survey of the upper Val Cluoza and
its three savage head-valleys: Diavel, Sassa, and
Valetta.  Descending eastward to the old sheep-pastures
of Laschaida, we come to the first outposts
of forests, hoary, battered larch, which, as the path
drops steeply down, gradually give place to fir.  At
the bottom we emerge on the pastures of Praspol by
the turbid Spol, one of the largest tributaries of the
Inn, rich in trout, and a last refuge of the hard-bested
otter, who can now live and multiply there in peace,
doubtless giving a wide berth to the right bank for
the two miles along which the Spol forms the Park
boundary.  It will be interesting to note if fish do
the same; the right of fishing from this bank is
reserved to the commune of Zernez.  We may cross
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P54"></a>54}</span>
the stream by the Punt Praspol, leaving the Park
for a while, or we may take on the right a lonely
and bewitching forest path that runs above the left
bank of the Spol, crosses it by the Punt Purif, and
descends to the point where, half an hour below
Fuorn, the post-road re-enters the Park.
</p>

<p>
Those not in a hurry will do well to spread this
walk, with digressions that will readily suggest
themselves, over the second day, passing the night at
Fuorn.  If pressed for time, however, an early start
from the blockhouse will enable good walkers to get
on to S-charl or Tarasp.  A quarter of an hour above
Fuorn on the road to the Pass, by the second bridge,
which crosses a gully, a footpath on the left through
the forest brings us into the Val del Botsch, abounding
in chamois, and ascends steeply to the Fuorcletta,
a low saddle between towering dolomite peaks.
Looking back as we ascend is an ever-widening
prospect of serried summits and savage gorges.  Very
striking, too, as we thread the stony trough, is the
contrast between the stark desolation around and the
soft rich hues of the Lower Engadine, with a crowded
host of peaks rising behind and about them.  The
path then leaves the Park, and is for a while in the
Verbindungsgebiet, descending to Alp Plavna, turning
to the left, ascending, and re-entering the Park at
the pleasant col of Sur il Foss; then descending the
Val Minger, it strikes the Clemgia a couple of miles
below the lone, forest-begirt hamlet of S-charl.  The
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P55"></a>55}</span>
once busy iron-smelting village has dwindled to a
dozen houses with their little church on a holm of the
rushing Clemgia.  The name of the secular Jurada
forest on the left records an ancient reserve banned to
axe and saw as a protection from avalanches.  To
the south the wild and beautiful valley is closed by
the snow-flecked dolomite peaks of the Pisoc.  A
half-day's walk down the right bank of the stream,
along the eastern edge of the Park, takes us by the
Clemgia Gorge to Tarasp.

<p>
'The course of nature' as exhibited in such experiments
as the Swiss National Park irresistibly calls to
mind the headlong history of the world during the ten
years that have passed since its inauguration.  The
teaching of nature had been studiously assimilated
by a great nation to which the world is deeply
indebted in every field of thought, science, and research;
it was made the basis of their national policy, and put
in practice with every resource of skill and deliberation.
The results have been catastrophic, and would
seem to show that when man became a social
being&mdash;and we may perhaps extend the statement to all
society, however inchoate, from the pack and the
herd to the hive and the ant-heap&mdash;he entered a new
plane of evolution, and that those who would apply to
it the crude methods of selection that operated in
more primitive and individual stages are fighting
against the stars in their courses.

VI
<br><br>
WINTER
</h3>

<p>
The attraction of the Alpine winter, which till lately
was a pious cult of the elect, has become a common-place
of advertisements and agencies.  Every year a
larger crowd gathers in what used to be considered
frost-bound solitudes, and some new resort is opened
for the Christmas holiday-maker.  Among such
resorts the Engadine, with its dry air, clear sky, and
brilliant sunshine, takes a foremost place.  At no
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P58"></a>58}</span>
time is it more lovely and enjoyable, more unlike the
surroundings we have left at home, more recuperative
to jaded denizens of the town.  It would be difficult
to find a gayer and busier scene than its frozen lakes
and snow-clad slopes present in winter.  Even the
work that goes on partakes of the general exhilaration.
Sleighs and toboggans replace carts and barrows,
lightening the labour of man and beast, and
adding a novel animation to transport and locomotion.
Bound and buried though Nature be, the work of
those who deal with her is by no means at a stand-still;
the universal snow, instead of staying it, inaugurates
a general transport system, converting rough
mountain roads into smooth and facile descents; little
more than guidance and gravitation is needed to
bring the hay mown in summer and the timber felled
in autumn from the distant uplands to the villages
and homesteads where they should be.  Nothing is
more enjoyable than to take a passage down on a
sleigh laden with hay or faggots, to rush through the
keen air over glistening slopes, or along winding
forest ways, or in the trough of steep gullies that
centuries of similar traffic have cut through copse
and wood; most admirable is the adroitness with
which a practised mountaineer pilots his wayward
and unwieldy craft, which, if once it 'take charge,'
runs a mad career as fatal to its crew as to wayfarers
in its path.
</p>

<p>
Sports are organized in the most business-like
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P59"></a>59}</span>
manner, and are as cosmopolitan as the human crowd;
northern and mountain lands in all quarters of the
globe have contributed to them, and when the short
sunny day is over, keen brilliant nights, carnival balls
on the illuminated lakes, theatricals, dancing, and
unlimited miscellaneous fooling prolong the strenuous
enjoyment.
</p>

<p>
And then the setting of it all.  The exceeding
beauty and strangeness of the snow-clad earth, spotless
and radiant, like a bride adorned for her husband,
and the enchanting details that surround us, wander
where we will.  On every side cold and heat, wind
and moisture, play fantastic tricks before high heaven,
stereotyping cascades on the precipices, casing in
crystal the swirls and falls of streamlets, draping cliffs
and caves with iridescent fringe and lacework of ice.
Snow decorates the sombre towers of pine and fir as
with jewelled fleece, and bows to an added grace the
pliant larch-limbs on which remnants of autumn
foliage still linger in brushes of tawny gold;
hoar-frost weaves fairy-like embroidery over twigs and
leaves; shadows chequer the stainless ground with
exquisite pencilling; all the familiar objects of
wayside, croft and fell suffer a winter change into
something rich and strange.
</p>

<p>
He who would see all this at its best and at his
ease must take to skis, for the gift of which the Alps
owe an incalculable debt to Norway.  The introduction
is comparatively recent, but the alacrity with
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P60"></a>60}</span>
which it has been taken up shows how thoroughly
it met a want.  Detachments of the Swiss army are
exercised on skis every winter, and the citizen soldiers
have taken the accomplishment back to their
mountain homes, where it has been eagerly adopted.
Children may be seen on home-made skis trooping to
the often distant school, or having the time of their
lives on slopes and plateaux.
</p>

<p>
Those who do not cultivate it as a spectacular
sport may welcome ski-ing as a means of locomotion,
enabling them to go to places otherwise inaccessible, to
pass swiftly and lightly over snow in which unskied
bipeds would flounder up to the knees, if not over the
head.  What matters it to the humble novice that
his course seem but shambling and shuffling to the
winner of cups and breaker of records.  What is that to
him as he brushes over the sparkling slopes and threads
the cloistral hills?  He will find himself on shining
plateaux bathed in hazy light and walled in the
shimmering distance with ethereal ramparts.  He will pass
into solemn depths of forest where the winding way
is edged and arched with pines that stretch on either
hand into illimitable aisles.  Sometimes his path will
lead him to a radiant sanctuary where Nature seems
taking her winter rest in undisturbed repose; no
breath of wind breaks the stillness, nor note of bird,
nor human footfall; the earth as he ascends is
transfigured with new and strange magnificence, the
heaven deepens to a diviner blue and the shadows to
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P61"></a>61}</span>
more mystic purple, the peaks close round and rise
cathedral-like on every side: a cathedral vast and
soaring, vaulted with unfathomable sky, piled and
pinnacled, sculptured and wrought, beyond any
architect's imagining, and clothed with light as with a
garment.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG&#8482;
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away&#8212;you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark
license, especially commercial redistribution.

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms

</blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;

must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any

other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

provided that:

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are

        &#8226; You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies

        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        works.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all

LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the

accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
